# scaling and offset circuit calculator

this program generates component values for a scaling and offset circuit using 'designing gain and offset in thirty seconds' - Application Report SLOA097 (Texas Instruments)

I just wanted to play with rust, it was quite fun to make this and I tried to handle all errors possible (i still want to check for NaNs in output). If you use this and find errors please let me know with an issue.
